<br><br><br>


## üóÑÔ∏è Integrating Google sheets
This applications uses Google Sheets as our data storage solution. We connected Health Pilot with google sheets with the help of Google Sheets API which is available on Google Cloud. The below are the steps followed to acheive the connection with google sheets:
- Create a new project on Google Cloud and enable the Google Sheets API.
- Create a API credentials and generate its JSON key file.
- Create a new google sheet and give the 'client email' from json key file the editor access.
- Now, install the required Python libraries in the project to establish the connection:<br><br>
  gspread, google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib and google-auth-httplib2
    
    ```bash
    pip install gspread google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
    
    ```

    <br><br>


## üî® Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:<br><br>

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Python&logoColor=white)
![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-FF4B4B.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Streamlit&logoColor=white)

<br>

- Streamlit
    
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    
    ```
    
- Plotly
    
    ```bash
    pip install plotly
    
    ```
    

    
- OpenAI
    
    ```bash
    pip install openai
    
    ```
    
- Streamlit Option Menu
    
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit-option-menu
    
    ```
    

While the other libraries are already present in your Python Standard Library. Additionally, for using the openai library, you need to have an OpenAI API key. Make sure to set up your OpenAI API key and store it securely. You can follow the OpenAI documentation to obtain your API key. Once you have your API key, you can set it up in your project by using dotenv to load environment variables from a file. Create a file named .env in your project directory and add the following line:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

```

Replace <i><b>your_api_key_here</b></i> with your actual OpenAI API key. Lastly, in your Python code, add the following lines at the beginning:

```bash
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

```
